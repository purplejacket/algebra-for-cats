        <h1>Questions</h1>

        <h3>1.Here is an interesting fact about the “tangent” function: Math.tan(a+b) == (Math.tan(a) + Math.tan(b)) / (1 - Math.tan(a) * Math.tan(b)).  Let’s suppose you had two angles, x and y and you knew that Math.tan(x) == 3/4 and Math.tan(y) == 12/5.  Use your skills with grade school math to evaluate Math.tan(x+y) — specifically, do not use the console.  Show all the little steps of your solution.</h3>
        <h4>Math.tan(x) + Math.tan(y) = Math.tan(x+y)<br>
            Math.tan(x) = 3/4<br>
            Math.tan(y) = 12/5<br>
            Math.tan(x) + Math.tan(y) = Math.tan(x+y) = 12/5 + 3/4 = 63/20<br>
            /<br>
            (1 - Math.tan(x) * Math.tan(y))<br>
             1 -9/5 = (-4/5)<br>
            (63/20) / (-4/5) = -63/16</h4>
        <h3>2.On the same graph show f(x) = Math.tan(x) and g(x) = 1 / Math.tan(x).  Write a sentence with some observations about this graph.</h3>

        <h4>I notice that the lines are inverted.</h4>
        <h3>3.Do question 2 first.  Now: Try to use mental math to graph the function h(x) = 1/x.  Write a sentence describing what you think it will look like.  Then graph the function.  (By now you should know that I expect to see a screenshot of this graph in your answer.)  Next, write a sentence to see if the image of the graph compares to what your mental model was before; write down some thoughts / observations.  Finally write a sentence that compares the graph for h(x) to the graph you got for #2.</h3>

        <h4>I believe that it should look like 2 parabolic arcs, one in quadrant 3 and one in quadrant 1<br>
        So, as I predicted, they are parabolic (hyperbolic) arcs in the 3rd and 1st quadrant. More specificly, they are horizontal and vertical asymptotes. The lines seem to line up at around the f(x) = x, when x is -0.5 and diverge when x = 0.5.</h4>
        <h3>4.Graph the function (x) => Math.tan(x) and the function (x) => Math.atan(x) on the same graph.  Write a sentence with some thoughts about what you see.</h3>

            <h4>Math.atan(x) never seems to reach the infinity (or negative infinity) point. It doesn't seem to drop off.            </h4>
        <h3>5.Easy console work:<br>
        Math.tan(Math.atan(1))<br>
        Math.atan(Math.tan(1))<br>
        Math.tan(Math.atan(0.5))<br>
        Math.atan(Math.tan(0.5))</h3>
