        <h1>Questions</h1>

        <h3>1.Here is an interesting fact about the “tangent” function: Math.tan(a+b) == (Math.tan(a) + Math.tan(b)) / (1 - Math.tan(a) * Math.tan(b)).  Let’s suppose you had two angles, x and y and you knew that Math.tan(x) == 3/4 and Math.tan(y) == 12/5.  Use your skills with grade school math to evaluate Math.tan(x+y) — specifically, do not use the console.  Show all the little steps of your solution.</h3>
        <h3>2.On the same graph show f(x) = Math.tan(x) and g(x) = 1 / Math.tan(x).  Write a sentence with some observations about this graph.</h3>
        <h3>3.Do question 2 first.  Now: Try to use mental math to graph the function h(x) = 1/x.  Write a sentence describing what you think it will look like.  Then graph the function.  (By now you should know that I expect to see a screenshot of this graph in your answer.)  Next, write a sentence to see if the image of the graph compares to what your mental model was before; write down some thoughts / observations.  Finally write a sentence that compares the graph for h(x) to the graph you got for #2.</h3>
        <h3>4.Graph the function (x) => Math.tan(x) and the function (x) => Math.atan(x) on the same graph.  Write a sentence with some thoughts about what you see.</h3>
        <h3>5.Easy console work:<br>
        Math.tan(Math.atan(1))<br>
        Math.atan(Math.tan(1))<br>
        Math.tan(Math.atan(0.5))<br>
        Math.atan(Math.tan(0.5))</h3>
        <h3>6.Create 5 crazy cool functions and put them all on the same graph.  Be artistic.</h3>
        <h3>7.Prepare 5 basic functions for a round of “guess the function,” and be prepared with ideas on how to help us figure them out in case we get stuck.</h3>
        <h3>8.Create a video of you counting from 0 to 31 in base 2 using your hand.</h3>
        <h3>9.Write a function toBinary that takes a number and returns a string having that number converted to base 2.  For example, toBinary(13) should return the string "0b1101".</h3>
        <h3>10.Write a function toDecimal that takes a string containing a number expressed as a string in base 2 and returns a number.  For example, toDecimal('0b1101') should return 13.</h3>
        <h3>11.Read this wikipedia article:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function (or the Spanish equivalent). </h3>
        <h3>12.Choose your favorite example from the article and explain it in your own words. </h3>
        <h3>13.Explain why the article is relevant to the topics we are discussing in this homework assignment.</h3>
        <h3>14.Goldbach’s conjecture states that every even whole number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.
        a.Prove it up to 10.  Easy:<br>
        4 = 2 + 2<br>
        6 = 3 + 3<br>
        8 = 3 + 5<br>
        10 = 3 + 7<br>
        b.Prove it up to 1000 by implementing your algorithm from the previous homework.</h3>
