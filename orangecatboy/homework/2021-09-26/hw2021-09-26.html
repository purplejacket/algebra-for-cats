<h1>Homework Due September 26</h1>
<h5>1. Is this a dog or a cat?  Would a computer be able to answer this question?  Discuss.</h5>
<a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zjlOx7TRclFMwXsa5cJ3dVB4A4lGTbF5nGpsZryrke0/edit">link</a>
    <h5>2. Install surge.sh.  We will use this for question 3.  Take a look at the documentation and/or the 3 minute video.  Write a few sentences describing how it works, and what is different between the free and paid versions.</h5>
    <h4> Surge.sh is a platform that lets you deploy code onto a server.</h4>
        <h5>3. For the homework that was due July 4, turn it into an html file with associated image files. Take a screenshot of the top part of that as deployed on surge.sh, use MacOS Preview to scale it to a width of 1000, then put that screenshot here.</h5>
        <h4>Here you go:</h4>

            <h5>4. Write 5 crooked, multi-faceted, uproarious, impulsive, mechanistic, convoluted, inimitable, bow-legged, fine-grained, intense functions … and put them all on the same graph. </h5>
            <pre><code class="language-js">    
            const f = (x) => x*x - x + 41;
            const d = (x) => x*f(x)/20;
            const b = (x) => d(x)*f(x)/20;
            const g = (x) => Math.sin(b(x));
            const r = (x) => Math.random(f(x));

                <h5>5. In the xy-plane the red curve is the graph of some anonymous function, and the blue straight line is tangent to the red curve at some point in the fourth quadrant.  Does the tangent line have a positive or negative slope?  Approximately what is the slope of that line?  Explain.</h5>
                <h4>negative -1/2</h4>
                    <h5>6. Mental math:  Go through the list of all 1 and 2 digit primes in your head.  This might take a few minutes.  Then look here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number#Definition_and_examples -- how many primes did you miss?  How many non-primes did you think were primes?  Which were these?  Would a computer be able to answer this question?  Discuss.</h5>
                    <h4>I missed 2 primes. a computer could definitely answer this.</h4>
                        <h5>7. Write a function signFunc(x) that returns:<br>
a. 1 if x is positive<br>
b. 0 if x is zero<br>
c. -1 if x is negative</h5>
<pre><code class="language-js">function signFunc(x) {
    if (x == 0){
        return 0;
    } else if (x < 0) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h5>8. Write a function signProduct(nums) that takes an array of numbers and calculates the signFunc of the product of those numbers.</h5>
<pre><code class="language-js">
    function signProduct(nums){
        var num = 1;
        for (let i=0; i < nums.length; i++){
            let b = signFunc(nums[i]);
            num = num*b;
        }
        return num;
    }
</code></pre>
    <h5>9. Take 3 different screenshots of Screepslandia on three different days, preferably spread out over 10 or more days.  Explain what is going on, and what is changing from one screenshot to the next. </h5>

    <h4>Mostly just a lot of CPU issues, havent really being focusing on it lately.</h4>
        <h5>10. Do a git pull on the https://github.com/purplejacket/algebra-for-cats repository.  Notice the new kaboomy directory.  This is a direct copy of Kenneth's game -- we call this a "fork". <br>
Alex and Cris:  add some new levels to the game; you can also modify existing levels as you like.  Please communicate between the two of you as you work -- this is an exercise in using git as well as kaboomjs. <br>
Kenneth:  please help Alex and Cris if you like; also, feel free to modify your original copy of the game as you like.<br>
Show some code snippets and screenshots and explain what you've done.</h5>
    <h5>11. Play the Flexbox Zombies game and get through a few more levels.  Take 2 screenshots when the game is particularly interesting or notable and explain what is going on.</h5>

    <h4>learning new methods in flexbox and practicing them.</h4>
        <h5>12. Let f(x) = x² - x + 41.  Prove or disprove that f(n) is prime for all non-negative integers n. </h5>
        <h4>if x is 41:<br>
            f(x) = 1681 - 41 + 41<br>
            1681 is not prime.</h4>
