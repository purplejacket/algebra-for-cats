    <h1>Questions</h1>
    
<h3>Can you schedule a Screeps session for:<br>
Monday Aug 2?<br>
Friday Aug 6?<br>
Thanks.<br></h3>

<h4>done, we had a session on Aug 6</h4>

<h3>Do you remember this interesting fact about the tangent function from trigonometry?  Math.tan(a+b) == (Math.tan(a) + Math.tan(b)) / (1 - Math.tan(a) * Math.tan(b)).  Let’s suppose you had two angles, x and y and you knew that Math.tan(x) == 3/5 and Math.tan(y) == 15/7.  Use your skills with grade school math to evaluate Math.tan(x+y) — specifically, do not use the console.  Show all the little steps of your solution.<br></h3>

<h4>Math.tan(x) + Math.tan(y) = Math.tan(x+y)<br>
Math.tan(x) = 3/5<br>
Math.tan(y) = 15/7<br>
Math.tan(x) + Math.tan(y) = Math.tan(x+y) = 3/5 + 15/7 = 96/35<br>
/<br>
(1 - Math.tan(x) * Math.tan(y))<br>
1 - 9/7 = -(2/7) <br>
(96/35) / (-2/7) = -9 and 3/5</h4>

<h3>Theoretically, what is the minimum number of bits of computer memory that you would need to represent the number:<br>
5<br>
50<br>
500<br></h3>

<h4>3,6,9</h4>

<h3>Write a paragraph to explain the unit circle. Include an image that you find from the web, and give at least five different examples of points on the unit circle with an explanation for each.  Also, your answer should address what is “radians”.<br></h3>
<h3>On the same graph show (x) => Math.sin(x) and (x) => 1 / Math.sin(x).  Write a sentence with some observations about this graph.<br></h3>
<h3>What is an interesting similarity between the graph of (x) => 1 / Math.sin(x) and (x) => 1 / x?  Explain why this similarity exists.<br></h3>
<h3>On the same graph show Math.sin(x) and Math.asin(x).  Write a sentence with some observations about this graph.<br></h3>
<h3>Easy console work:<br>
Math.sin(Math.asin(1))<br>
Math.asin(Math.sin(1))<br>
Math.sin(Math.asin(Math.PI / 4))<br>
Math.asin(Math.sin(Math.PI / 4))<br></h3>
<h3>Create 5 crazy cool functions and put them all on the same graph.<br></h3>
<h3>Prepare 5 basic functions for a round of “guess the function,” and be prepared with ideas on how to help us figure them out in case we get stuck.<br></h3>
<h3>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.<br></h3>
<h3>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.  What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?<br></h3>
<h3>Modify your toBinary so that it optionally takes a second parameter which is how many zeroes to add to make the answer longer.  Examples:<br></h3>
toBinary(13) == '0b1101'<br>
toBinary(13, 4) == '0b1101'<br>
toBinary(13, 5) == '0b01101'<br>
toBinary(13, 6) == '0b001101'<br>
toBinary(13, 7) == '0b0001101'<br>
toBinary(13, 8) == '0b00001101'<br>
toBinary(13, 9) == '0b000001101'<br></h3>
toBinary(13, 2) == '0b1101'  — (here, the second parameter is too small, so it is ignored)<br></h3>
<h3>Using mental math only:  What is 14 squared?  Do not check your answer, unless you check it mentally.  In fact, don’t write your answer down, just remember it.  Write a sentence describing how difficult this exercise was to do.<br></h3>
<h3>Let’s define a function called gm like this:  gm(x) equals (x-1) factorial if x is an integer bigger than zero, otherwise gm(x) equals zero.  Using a length of 10 with an offset at (-9, -9), graph the gm function.<br></h3>
<h3>Do you remember our "guess the number" game?  For instance:  I pick a number from 1 to 100.  You guess 50.  I say higher, you say 75.  I say lower, you say 63.  I say lower, you say 57.  I say higher, you say 60.  I say lower, you say 59.  I say lower, and now you have it:  58.  This is called a binary search, because we are always cutting the remaining search space in half.  Write a sentence or two describing the algorithm.  In a future homework we will implement this algorithm.<br></h3>
