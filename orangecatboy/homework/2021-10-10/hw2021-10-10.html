  <h5>1. Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers.</h5>
  <h4 class="answer">Let's approach this question by assuming there are a finite number of prime numbers.<br>
  largestprime = the largest prime number<br>
  primelist = 2*3*5...*largestprime+1<br>
  is primelist divisible by 2? No, there is a remainder of 1.<br>
  is primelist divisible by 3? No, there is a remainder of 1.<br>
  is primelist divisible by 5? No, there is a remainder of 1.<br>
  is primelist divisible by 7? No, there is a remainder of 1.<br>
  is primelist divisible by 11? No, there is a remainder of 1.<br>
  is primelist divisible by 13? No, there is a remainder of 1.<br>
  If we repeat this process, we reach the question:<br>
  is primelist divisible by largest prime? No, there is a remainder of 1.<br>
  primelist is not divisible by largestprime, making it a prime number.<br>
  we have found a contridiction, therefore there are not a finite, but infinite number of primes.<br>

  <h5>2. Install the <span class="emphasis">pngquant</span> command on your mac to compress png files.  We will use this for all png files going forward to conserve space.  Run the following commands, then copy the output as the answer to this question.  Run in a directory where you have a png file -- here coolFuncs.png is used as an example, replace that with your own file.</h5>

  <pre><code class="language-js">    
  brew install pngquant
  pngquant --help
  pngquant coolFuncs.png
  ls -l coolFuncs*
  </code></pre>
  <h4 class="answer">done</h4>
  <h5>3. For the homework that was due June 25, turn it into an html file with associated image files.  Take a screenshot and put that as your answer here.  Remember:  use <span class="emphasis">pngquant</span> to compress the screenshot.
  
    <h5>4. Easy console work:
    a. a = []
    b. for (i=0;i<=16;i++) { a.push(2**i) }
    c. console.table(a)
  <img src="num4.png" width=200>
    <h5>5. Mental math:  Study the table you produced in the last question.  Prepare to say these numbers from memory as an exercise in class.  Use “spaced repetition” -- repeat this study on 3 different days.  On the third day write a sentence with some comments regarding what is easy and what is hard about this exercise.
  <h4 class="answer">Day 1 Complete.</h4>
      <h5>6. Write two functions (see below) that depend on Unicode.  In https://gist.github.com/ivandrofly/0fe20773bd712b303f78 you’ll need lines 154, 155, 161 and 614-637.  Run all of the following <span class="emphasis">console.assert</span> commands to make sure your code is correct.  If your code is not correct you will get <span class="emphasis">Assertion failed</span> (correct code will just return undefined ... a little weird, but run with it).<br>
    a. Write a function <span class="emphasis">xToThe(n)</span> that returns a string of x to the n, where n is any integer.  Examples:<br>
      I. <span class="emphasis">console.assert(xToThe(12) == "x¹²")</span><br>
      II. <span class="emphasis">console.assert(xToThe(370) == "x³⁷⁰")</span><br>
      III. <span class="emphasis">console.assert(xToThe(-5) == "x⁻⁵")</span><br>
      IV. <span class="emphasis">console.assert(xToThe(1234567890) == "x¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹⁰"</span><br>
    b. Write a function <span class="emphasis">xSub(n)</span> that returns a string of x with a subscript of n, where n is a non-negative integer.  Examples:<br>
      I. <span class="emphasis">console.assert(xSub(0) == "x₀");</span><br>
      II. <span class="emphasis">console.assert(xSub(4) == "x₄");</span><br>
      III. <span class="emphasis">console.assert(xSub(678) == "x₆₇₈");</span><br>
      <h5>7. Create six different images, and list which functions you choose for each:<br><br>
  A. A graph with five degree 0 polynomial functions<br>
  B. A graph with five degree 1 polynomial functions<br>
  C. A graph with five degree 2 polynomial functions<br>
  D. A graph with five degree 3 polynomial functions<br>
  E. A graph with five degree 4 polynomial functions<br>
  F. A graph with five degree 5 polynomial functions<br>
  <h5>8. Write 5 creative and complicated functions and put them all on the same graph.  This time two simple rules:<br>
  A. no pure polynomial functions<br>
  B. no use of <span class="emphasis">Math.random</span><br>
  <h5>9. Screeps update:<br>
  A. Show a screenshot of Screeps and describe what’s going on<br>
  B. 2 days later:  show another screenshot, and describe what has changed<br>
  C. 3 days after that:  show a third screenshot, describe what has changed,<br>
  D. Write a summary describing the whole arc of what happened<br>
  <h5>10. Zombie Flexbox game.  Go through two more levels.  Take two screenshots at interesting moments and explain all of the Flex details you are working on.
    <h5>11. What is “nullish coalescing”, the new operator <span class="emphasis">??</span> introduced into JavaScript in the year 2020?  Do some research/reading, then explain these:<br>
  A. x = null; y = x ?? “hello”;<br>
  B. x = undefined; y = x ?? “hello”;<br>
  C. x = 3.14; y = x ?? “hello”;<br>
  D. x = false; y = x ?? “hello”;<br>
  E. x = NaN; y = x ?? “hello”;<br>
  F. x = “”; y = x ?? “hello”;<br>
  G. x = []; y = x ?? “hello”;<br>
  H. x = 0; y = x ?? “hello”;<br>
  I. x = {}; y = x ?? “hello”;<br>
  <h5>12. Go to the Tensorflow Playground -- https://playground.tensorflow.org -- and solve each of the four datasets.  Take a screenshot of each solution.  Discuss.
