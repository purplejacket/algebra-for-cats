  <h1>Alex's Homework Due March 5th 2021</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>The following questions are from GMAT Prep Plus 2019, ISBN 1506234895, page 709:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If z is an integer is z even? You are given:</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>(z+m) / 3 = 2m + 1 where m is an integer</li>
          <li>z³ is even</li>
        </ol>
        <li>The set S contains n integers.  Is the sum of all the elements of set S odd?  You are given:</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>All the elements of S are prime numbers</li>
          <li>n = 2</li>
        </ol>
        <li>If m is an odd number and p is a prime number, which of the following must be odd?</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>mp</li>
          <li>m(m + p)</li>
          <li>m - p</li>
          <li>m² + 2p² + 1</li>
          <li>m²(m + 2p)</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>For the homework that was due June 11, 2021, turn it into an html file with associated image files.  Include a screenshot here.</li>

    <li>In p5js draw a box that’s 800x800 pixels with a blue border and then draw a circle with a red border that fits snugly within that.  Then write a loop that iterates 4000 times; each time it will choose a random x value from 1-800 and a random y value from 1-800 and draw a dot at (x,y) within your square.</li>

    <li>In p5js draw a box that’s 800x800 pixels and make it look like graph paper.
      <ol type="i">
        <li>write a function that can fill in some of the squares to form a smiley face</li>
        <li>write a function that can fill it some of the squares to form the “glider” image</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    
    <li>Here we have an image of a square within a square.  Recreate this image in p5js and enhance it as described below.  Also, answer the questions.
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Create an 800x800 canvas to contain your image.  Make the blue square have size 600x600.  (Pixels)</li>
        <li>In the blue square add the perpendicular line symbol to indicate that the outer corners are 90° angles.</li>
        <li>Just using your eyeball, what do you estimate is the degree measure of the smaller angle of the blue triangles?  Or better, if you have a protractor, hold it up to the screen and try to get a measure accurate to a degree or so.  Another method would be to play with the online interactive unit circle and make a similar triangle:  <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-interactive-unit-circle.html">https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-interactive-unit-circle.html</a>  -- and  then look at what angle measure you have.</li>
        <li></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
