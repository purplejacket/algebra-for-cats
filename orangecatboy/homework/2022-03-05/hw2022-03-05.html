  <h1>Alex's Homework Due March 5th 2021</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>The following questions are from GMAT Prep Plus 2019, ISBN 1506234895, page 709:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If z is an integer is z even? You are given:</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>(z+m) / 3 = 2m + 1 where m is an integer</li>
          <li>z³ is even</li>
        </ol>
        <li>The set S contains n integers.  Is the sum of all the elements of set S odd?  You are given:</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>All the elements of S are prime numbers</li>
          <li>n = 2</li>
        </ol>
        <li>If m is an odd number and p is a prime number, which of the following must be odd?</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>mp</li>
          <li>m(m + p)</li>
          <li>m - p</li>
          <li>m² + 2p² + 1</li>
          <li>m²(m + 2p)</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>For the homework that was due June 11, 2021, turn it into an html file with associated image files.  Include a screenshot here.</li>

    <li>In p5js draw a box that's 800x800 pixels with a blue border and then draw a circle with a red border that fits snugly within that.  Then write a loop that iterates 4000 times; each time it will choose a random x value from 1-800 and a random y value from 1-800 and draw a dot at (x,y) within your square.</li>

    <li>In p5js draw a box that's 800x800 pixels and make it look like graph paper.
      <ol type="i">
        <li>write a function that can fill in some of the squares to form a smiley face</li>
        <li>write a function that can fill it some of the squares to form the “glider” image</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    
    <li>Here we have an image of a square within a square.  Recreate this image in p5js and enhance it as described below.  Also, answer the questions.
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Create an 800x800 canvas to contain your image.  Make the blue square have size 600x600.  (Pixels)</li>
        <li>In the blue square add the perpendicular line symbol to indicate that the outer corners are 90° angles.</li>
        <li>Just using your eyeball, what do you estimate is the degree measure of the smaller angle of the blue triangles?  Or better, if you have a protractor, hold it up to the screen and try to get a measure accurate to a degree or so.  Another method would be to play with the online interactive unit circle and make a similar triangle:  <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-interactive-unit-circle.html">https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-interactive-unit-circle.html</a>  -- and  then look at what angle measure you have.</li>
        <li>In all four of the blue triangles label the smaller acute angle as θ (theta).</li>
        <li>There is a theorem in geometry that says all of the angles of a triangle add up to ⅅ degrees.  What is the value of ⅅ?</li>
        <li>Given your answer to that last question, and looking at the blue triangles, what can you conclude about the value of larger acute angles relative to θ?</li>
        <li>Label all of those four larger acute angles with the value you just derived.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      Basic concepts of mathematical Set Theory:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Show an example of a set containing 5 integers</li>
        <li>The empty set is written like this {}.  And remember, ∩ means “intersection”. For instance, {1, 2, 3} ∩ {9, 10, 11, 12} = {}.  The empty set is also written like this: ∅.</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Give an example of two sets whose intersection is ∅.</li>
          <li>Give an example of two sets whose intersection is not ∅.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Give three examples of infinite sets.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>𝓟 -- the power set.  Let 𝓟(x) be the function that takes a set x and returns a set containing all of the subsets of x.  For example, suppose x is the set containing just the numbers 1 and 2, i.e., x={1, 2}.  (Note: this is mathematical notation, not JavaScript notation.)  Then 𝓟({1, 2}) = {{}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}.  Evaluate the following:</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>𝓟({1, 2, 3})</li>
      <li>𝓟({2, 3, 4})</li>
      <li>𝓟({1, 2, 3, 4})</li>
      <li>𝓟({2, 3, 4, 5}) ∩ 𝓟({4, 5, 6, 7})</li>
    </ol>

    <li>
      Set membership.  Answer true/false to the questions below.  For reference, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_%28mathematics%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_%28mathematics%29</a>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>1 ∈ {1, 2, 3, 27}</li>
        <li>10 ∈ {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31}</li>
        <li>1048 ∈ {2ⁿ: where n is an integer}</li>
        <li>Let A = {all real numbers less than 100}, B = {all real numbers greater than π} -- 10 ∈ A ∩ B</li>
        <li>7 ∈ the set of prime numbers</li>
        <li>7 ∈ the set of solutions to the equation (x-4)(x+3)(2x+1)(x+5) = 0</li>
        <li>{1, 2} ∈ {1, 3, {1, 2}, 5, {5}}</li>
        <li>{1, 2, 3} ∈ 𝓟({1, 2, 3, 4})</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      Now, sets in JavaScript.  Easy console work, then write a paragraph explaining what's going on:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>const mySet1 = new Set()</li>
        <li>mySet1.add(1)</li>
        <li>mySet1.add(5)</li>
        <li>mySet1.add(5)</li>
        <li>mySet1.add("some text")</li>
        <li>const o = {a: 1, b: 2}</li>
        <li>mySet1.add(o)</li>
        <li>mySet1.add({a: 1, b: 2}) // on this one, things get interesting ...</li>
        <li>mySet1.has(1)</li>
        <li>mySet1.has(3)</li>
        <li>mySet1.has(5)</li>
        <li>mySet1.has(Math.sqrt(25))</li>
        <li>mySet1.has('Some Text'.toLowerCase())</li>
        <li>mySet1.has(o)</li>
        <li>mySet1.size</li>
        <li>mySet1.delete(5)</li>
        <li>mySet1.has(5)</li>
        <li>mySet1.size</li>
        <li>console.log(mySet1)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      What is a Venn Diagram?  Discuss.
    </li>

    <li>
      Draw the following Venn Diagrams using p5js; do this question early during the assignment period:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>2 sets that intersect</li>
        <li>3 sets that intersect</li>
        <li>4 sets that intersect</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

  <li>For the previous question, when you drew 4 sets that intersected, did they intersect in all combinations of ways possible?  If not, use p5js to draw 4 sets that do intersect in all ways possible.</li>

  <li>Sets, a simple practical example: the set of amino acids, and its various subsets.  In the diagram:
    <ol>
      <li>What amino acids are both prolines and negatively charged?</li>
      <li>What is the set of amino acids that are both tiny and aromatic?</li>
      <li>Are polar amino acids a proper subset of the negatively charged amino acids?  (“Proper” meaning strictly smaller than the enclosing set.)</li>
      <li>List the amino acids that would be in the small subset minus the tiny subset.</li>
      <li>How many amino acids are there in the intersection of the aliphatic subset and the small subset?</li>
      <li>List the amino acids that are in the union of the aromatic and the positive subsets.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>Write a function gcd(a, b) that takes two non-negative integers a and b and uses the Euclidean Algorithm to find their Greatest Common Divisor.  For reference you can look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm</a>  or Number Theory: Euclidean Algorithm - An example by Socratica: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwuj4yzoX1o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwuj4yzoX1o</a>.  And then for completeness, show the previous <span class="emphasis">gcd</span> function you wrote that depended on <span class="emphasis">sieve</span>.</li>
  
  <li>We are going to find a way to list, in order, every single positive integer and fraction in the mathematical universe. Enumerate all of the rational numbers m/n first where m+n≤2, then m+n≤3, then m+n≤4, etc., omitting numbers that are not relatively prime; i.e., omit when gcd(m,n) > 1.  Write a function enumerateFractions(max) that will return an array of positive fractions.  (And max will be a positive integer greater than 1.)
    <ol type="a">
      <li>First it lists fractions m/n where m+n≤2.</li>
      <li>Then it lists fractions m/n where m+n≤3.</li>
      <li>Then it lists fractions m/n where m+n≤4.</li>
      <li>... (pattern continues)</li>
      <li>Then it lists fractions m/n where m+n≤<span class="emphasis">max</span>.</li>
      <li>It will omit fractions m/n when gcd(m,n) > 1.</li>
      <li>Make sure the following assertions pass:
        <ol type="i">
          <li>console.assert(enumerateFractions(2) == ['1/1']</li>
          <li>console.assert(enumerateFractions(3) == ['1/1', '2/1', '1/2']</li>
          <li>console.assert(enumerateFractions(4) == ['1/1', '2/1', '1/2', '3/1', '1/3']</li>
          <li>console.assert(enumerateFractions(5) == ['1/1', '2/1', '1/2', '3/1', '1/3', '4/1', '3/2', '2/3', '1/4']</li>
          <li>console.assert(enumerateFractions(6) == ['1/1', '2/1', '1/2', '3/1', '1/3', '4/1', '3/2', '2/3', '1/4', '5/1', '1/5']</li>
          <li>console.assert(enumerateFractions(7) == ['1/1', '2/1', '1/2', '3/1', '1/3', '4/1', '3/2', '2/3', '1/4', '5/1', '1/5', '6/1', '5/2', '4/3', '3/4', '2/5', '1/6']</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    A bus seats 52 people (see the floorplan).
    <ol>
      <li>First, as mental math, estimate:  How many ways can 52 people be arranged in this bus?  What order of magnitude do you get?  For example, if your estimate is a million arrangements, then your order of magnitude is 6 -- because a million has 6 zeroes.</li>
      <li>Now, calculate the exact number of arrangements</li>
      <li>Take the base 10 <span class="emphasis">log</span> of that result and compare it to the magnitude you guessed.  Discuss.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Write and show all of the following functions on the same <span class="emphasis">graph</span>:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>A first degree polynomial that crosses the x-axis at 1 point</li>
      <li>A second degree polynomial that crosses the x-axis at 0 points</li>
      <li>A second degree polynomial that touches the x-axis at exactly 1 point</li>
      <li>A second degree polynomial that crosses the x-axis at 2 points</li>
      <li>A third degree polynomial that crosses the x-axis at exactly 1 point</li>
      <li>A third degree polynomial that crosses/touches the x-axis at exactly 2 points</li>
      <li>A third degree polynomial that crosses the x-axis at exactly 3 points</li>
      <li>A fourth degree polynomial that crosses the x-axis at 0 points</li>
      <li>A fourth degree polynomial that touches the x-axis at exactly 1 point</li>
      <li>A fourth degree polynomial that crosses the x-axis at exactly 2 points</li>
      <li>A fourth degree polynomial that crosses/touches the x-axis at exactly 3 points</li>
      <li>A fourth degree polynomial that crosses the x-axis at exactly 4 points</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="emphasis">Graph</span> the following.  Make two graphs; first graph all of them on the same graph, then graph just <span class="emphasis">f</span> and <span class="emphasis">t₅</span> on the same graph.  Choose a viewing window that helps us see how these functions curve around.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>f(x) = sin(x)</li>
      <li>t₀(x) = x - x³/3!</li>
      <li>t₁(x) = x - x³/3!</li>
      <li>t₂(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5!</li>
      <li>t₃(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - x⁷/7!</li>
      <li>t₄(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - x⁷/7! + x⁹/9!</li>
      <li>t₅(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - x⁷/7! + x⁹/9! - x¹¹/11!</li>
      <li>“t” is for “Taylor Series” -- a series of increasingly accurate approximations</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Write 5 analytic, cogent, investigative, subtle, perceptive, inquisitive functions and put them all on the same <span class="emphasis">graph</span>.  Restrictions:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Only use these things to make your functions:
        <ol type="i">
          <li><span class="emphasis">log</span></li>

          <li>numbers</li>
          <li>function composition</li>
        </ol>
        <li>And make these definitions in your code:

            <li><span class="emphasis">const log = Math.log</span></li>
            <li><span class="emphasis">const abs = Math.abs</span></li>
          </ol>
        </li>

      <li>Write a summary describing the whole arc of what happened.  Include a few interesting code samples and explain them.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

Try to accomplish this at least 2³ times during the assignment period.  Discuss.</li>

  <li>Mental math at night:  again, before going to sleep, try this exercise:  go through all the prime numbers less than 169.  Note:  It helps if you know your multiples of 7 and 11 up to 169.  Do this five times during the assignment period.  After each time, check your work the next morning, write down the primes you missed or the numbers you thought were prime but were not.  After the 5 times, discuss.

      <li>Note:  For the above, you can either choose a function from <span class="emphasis">Math</span> or make up your own function.  Also, a subtlety:  We are talking about a "mathematical" function f (as compared to a JavaScript function) that works on real numbers, and not floating point numbers.  Floating point numbers can only approximate most real numbers (for example <span class="emphasis">Math.Pi</span> is an approximation of π).  The fact that we mention <span class="emphasis">Math</span> only means you might like to look there for examples.</li>
