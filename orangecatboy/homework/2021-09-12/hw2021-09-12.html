<h3>1.Which of the following points are on the unit circle?  Use the Pythagorean Theorem to prove your answers.  Bonus points:  Show a unit circle with all of these points and a label (a, b, c, …, k) next to each one.  That way we can clearly see which ones are on the circle, and which ones are not.<br>
