    <h1>Questions</h1>

    <h3>
    1.  Repurpose your graph function to draw a unit circle on a set of coordinate axes with graph paper.  <break>
        (By “repurpose” I mean:  copy your graph code to a new function called unitCircle and then modify the code.) Use a hard coded length of 4 <break>
        so that we can see a little context of the coordinate plane.  And use a hard-coded displaySize of 900. Then generate a random integer n <break>
        in the range [5, 15] and draw n random points on your unit circle.  How can you write your code so that when you “put a random point on the circle” it is <break>
        equally likely to be anywhere on the circle.  I.e., if you were to put a million random points they wouldn’t cluster up in any particular hot spots on the circle.<break></h3>
        
        
        <h3>2.    Graph the following three function on the same graph.  Write a sentence describing what’s going on here of mathematical significance.<break>
        (x) => x
        (x) => Math.exp(x)
        (x) => Math.log(x)</h3>

        <h4>The ones that curve are mirrored along the straight line.</h4>

        
    <h3>3. "Easy" console work:
        Math.exp(1)<break>
        Math.exp(2)<break>
        Math.exp(3)<break>
        Math.log(1)<break>
        Math.log(2)<break>
        Math.log(3)<break>
        Math.exp(Math.log(2))<break>
        Math.log(Math.exp(2))<break>
        Math.exp(Math.log(3))<break>
        Math.log(Math.exp(3))<break>
        Math.exp(Math.log(4))<break>
        Math.log(Math.exp(4))<break>
        Math.exp(Math.log(400))<break>
        Math.log(Math.exp(400))<break>
        Math.exp(Math.log(999))<break>
        Math.log(Math.exp(999))<break>
        Math.log(0)<break></h3>

        <h3>4.  On the same graph show (x) => Math.cos(x) and (x) => 1 / Math.cos(x).  Write a sentence with some observations about this graph.</h3>

        <h4>i notice that the bumps of the single wiggle are each touched by a matching pink curve</h4>
        <h3> 5. What is an interesting similarity between the graph of (x) => 1 / Math.cos(x) and (x) => 1 / x?  Explain why this similarity exists.</h3>
        
    <h3>6. Create 5 crazy cool functions and put them all on the same graph.  Try experimenting with composition of functions, for example if f = (x) => Math.cos(x) and g = (x) => x * x  try graphing “f of g of x” and also “g of f of x”.  Also, take a look at the MDN Math object, there are some functions there we haven’t seen yet.</h3>
        
<h3>7. Prepare 5 basic functions for a round of “guess the function,” and be prepared with ideas on how to help us figure them out in case we get stuck.</h3>
        
<h3>8. Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.  If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".  Example 1: Input: strs = [“flower”, “flow”, “flight”] — Output: “fl”.  Example 2: Input: strs = [“dog”, “racecar”, “car”] — Output: “”; Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.</h3>
        
<h3>9. Please give a brief update on Screepslandia.</h3>
        
<h3>10. A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.  Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.</h3>

<h3>11. Play around with Math.atan.  What’s the biggest possible value you can get?  What’s the smallest possible value you can get?</h3>

<h3>12. Consider the gamma function attached to this homework thread.  Write two or three sentences with observations about the code, but specifically don’t actually run the code.  Any ideas as to what this thing does?</h3>

<h3>13. Read this article:  https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjetura_de_Collatz -- write a brief but precise description explaining:  What is the Collatz Conjecture?</h3>

<h3>14. Design an algorithm then write a function collatzProof(num) that will prove the Collatz Conjecture for the integers from 1 through num.  Here's a helper question:  What might the output of collatzProof(4) look like?</h3>

<h3>15. Using mental math only:  What is 15 squared?  Do not check your answer, unless you check it mentally.  In fact, don’t write your answer down, just remember it.  Write a sentence describing how difficult this exercise was to do.</h3>

<h3>16. In the image below, what is the meaning of A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D ∩ E ∩ F in the center of the diagram?  In particular, what does that ∩ symbol mean?  Please give a clear written explanation.  By the way, this is an example of a Venn Diagram.</h3>
